# MicroMeta: Meta-analysis version of QCAT method

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


I provide a meta-analysis framework for Microbiome datasets from different sources based on the summary statistics generated by Quasi-Conditional Association (QCAT) tests. The meta-analysis methods are implemented in this package including fixed effect tests, for example, FE-SKAT test and multivariate test and random effect tests such as Het-SKAT and RE-SKAT test. If the taxonomic hierarchy is provided, the tests will be performed on the taxonomic tree to localize the covariate-associated lineages. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DriWater/MicroMeta")
```

## To do list:
I plan to finish the code for two part model(including both positive part model and zero part model), make vignette, move the code relevant to permutation method like Score.test.stat.perm, .Score.test.stat.pos.perm, .Score.test.stat.zero.perm,  
to cpp, complete the roxygen skeleton in the reminder of this semester. 

### Code:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] QCAT_Meta_GEE
\item[2.] cpp version of .Score.test.stat function 
\item[3.] cpp version of .Score.test.stat.pos function
\item[4.] cpp version of .Score.test.stat.zero function
\end{itemize}

### Make vignette

### Finsh the roxygen skeleton

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(MicroMeta)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
