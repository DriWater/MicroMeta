# MicroMeta: Meta-analysis version of QCAT


I provide a meta-analysis framework for Microbiome data sets from different studies based on the summary statistics generated by Quasi-Conditional Association (QCAT) tests[@tang2017general]. The meta-analysis methods in this package include fixed effect tests, for example, the FE-SKAT test and multivariate test, and random effect tests, like, Het-SKAT and RE-SKAT test[@MetaSKAT]. If the taxonomic hierarchy is provided, the tests will be performed on the taxonomic tree to localize the covariate-associated lineages.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DriWater/MicroMeta")
```

## To do list:

I plan to make vignette, complete the roxygen skeleton.
